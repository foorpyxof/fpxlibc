# Welcome to fpxlib-C :3

just a fun lil' side project i've been working on for a bit.
I'll keep updating it with more stuff as I go along on my journey to learn more C and C++

---

Includes C++ test-programs that you can build using 'make'.

---

# More Makefile instructions:

- ```make debug``` builds the library and all the test programs with debug flags enabled
- ```make compile``` only compile the library
- ```make compile_dbg``` ditto, but with debug flags enabled

## have fun uwu
