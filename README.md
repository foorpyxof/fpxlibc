# Welcome to fpxlib-C :3

just a fun lil' side project i've been working on for a bit.
I'll keep updating it with more stuff as I go along on my journey to learn more C and C++

---

Includes a lil' main.cpp test program that you can build using 'make'.
A debug-compatible version can be built with 'make debug'.

---

# More Makefile instructions:

- ```make tcpserver``` will make just the TCP server
- ```make tcpclient``` will make just the TCP client

Output file will be put in ./build/fpxLIB.out

## have fun uwu
