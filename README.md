# Welcome to fpxlib-C :3

just a fun lil' side project i've been working on for a bit.
I'll keep updating it with more stuff as I go along on my journey to learn more C and C++

## Makefile instructions:

- ```make``` to compile into libraries (.a for linux, .lib for windows)

## x86_64 assembly

Some parts of the library have been written in x86_64 assembly. These have not been processed into the build system yet, but will be soon

### have fun uwu
